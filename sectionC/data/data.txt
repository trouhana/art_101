Data collected by student interns at UC Santa Cruzâ€™s Forest Ecology Research Plot (FERP) recently contributed to a breakthrough in understanding how climate change affects forests. A new study published in Nature Communications analyzed data from UC Santa Cruz and hundreds of other long-term forest monitoring sites across North America to document that climate change is causing declines in seed production for older, larger trees in western forests while increasing seed production for younger, smaller trees in East Coast forests.
