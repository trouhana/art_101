Award-winning novelist Tommy Orange will be featured in conversation with literature professor Micah Perks, director of UCSC’s Creative Writing Program, in a live virtual event on Wednesday, March 3, at 6:30 p.m. 
This free online event follows a month of in-depth programming and community engagement by UCSC’s Humanities Institute through its Deep Read program. This year, it focused on Orange’s New York Times bestselling novel There There—a multi-generational, fast-paced story about the lives of urban Native Americans in Oakland, CA.
